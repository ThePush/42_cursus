## Goal of the project
Write a minimalist shell based on [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))

## Skills involved
* UNIX signals
* Pipes, forks, file descriptors redirections

## Features


Here are the main features of the project, taken from the subject:

```
Your shell should:

â€¢ Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.

â€¢ Have a working history.

â€¢ Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path).

â€¢ Not use more than one global variable. Think about it. You will have to explain
its purpose.

â€¢ Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the
subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).

â€¢ Handle â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.

â€¢ Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).

â€¢ Implement redirections:
â—¦ < should redirect input.
â—¦ > should redirect output.
â—¦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the history!
â—¦ >> should redirect output in append mode.

â€¢ Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.

â€¢ Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.

â€¢ Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.

â€¢ Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.

â€¢ In interactive mode:
â—¦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
â—¦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
â—¦ ctrl-\ does nothing.

â€¢ Your shell must implement the following builtins:
â—¦ echo with option -n
â—¦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
â—¦ pwd with no options
â—¦ export with no options
â—¦ unset with no options
â—¦ env with no options or arguments
â—¦ exit with no options
```
